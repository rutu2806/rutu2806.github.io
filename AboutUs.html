Pet Care we believe in a safe and happy world where pets get their way every day.
 This means enabling your pet to live life to its fullest. So even if you’re away,
  with Fetch! Pet Care, your pet can still play! We believe a pet needs regular 
  exercise in order to be happy and healthy, so we have designed a range of services 
  to meet the varied needs of dogs and cats.
We also believe that your pet should be in a “free range”,
 stress-free environment with one-on-one care, which is why we provide in-home pet 
 sitting where your pet will be free of the physical and emotional stress of a kennel,
  boarding or daycare facility or a “dog hotel”. So, when you’re away you’ll have the peace
   of mind knowing your pets can stay in the safety and comfort of your home and maintain
    their normal routine.
